# M<sup>3</sup> (Mechanics, Modeling and Machine Learning) Lab

Welcome to the M<sup>3</sup> Lab at IIT Madras! We work at the intersection of mechanics, mathematics and artificial intelligence to design, simulate and optimize next-generation systems and devices. Our lab's research focuses on developing theoretical frameworks, numerical models and machine learning methodologies to advance the mechanical design of engineering systems across multiple length scales — from macro to micro and nano. 

We utilize a combination of physics-based and data-driven techniques to investigate complex static and dynamic phenomena in solid and fluid mechanics. These tools are applied to a broad range of applications including microfluidics, hydrodynamic and elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication, data storage technologies (such as hard disk drives), hardware devices and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Please explore the Research and Publications sections to learn more about our ongoing work.
