# **M<sup>3</sup> Lab: Mechanics, Modeling and Machine Learning Lab**

Welcome to the M<sup>3</sup> Lab at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras! We work at the intersection of mechanics, mathematics and artificial intelligence to design, simulate and optimize next-generation systems and devices. In particular, our lab's research focuses on developing theoretical frameworks, numerical models and machine learning methodologies to advance the mechanical design of engineering systems across multiple length scales — from macro to micro and nano. 

We utilize a combination of physics-based and data-driven techniques to investigate complex static and dynamic phenomena in solid and fluid mechanics. These tools are applied to a broad range of applications including microfluidics, hydrodynamic and elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication, data storage technologies (such as hard disk drives), hardware devices and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Please explore the Research and Publications sections to learn more about our ongoing work.
