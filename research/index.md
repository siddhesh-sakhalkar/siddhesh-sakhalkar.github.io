Our research interests fall in the following categories: (1) Scientific Machine Learning for Engineering Simulations, (2) Structural Mechanics and Dynamics, with a focus on System Identification, Design Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification, (3) Fluid Mechanics and Fluid-Structure Interactions, particularly at the micro- and nanoscale. More information is given below by category.

## *(1) Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) for Engineering Simulations*

Designing complex engineering systems requires the formulation of non-linear, coupled, multi-physics models governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The high computational cost associated with solving these PDEs using traditional numerical methods—particularly in the context of repeated evaluations required for design optimization—represents a critical bottleneck for efficient and rapid design iterations. To address this challenge, we build new SciML models using state-of-the-art architectures, including neural operators and foundation models, to create robust, accurate and efficient surrogate models for PDE-governed systems. These surrogate models enable rapid approximation of the PDE solution operators and significantly reduce the computational burden associated with repeated PDE solves. 

Our research addresses complex, multiscale and multi-physics problems across solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, tribology and heat transfer. In particular, we emphasize the development of SciML methods with direct applicability to real-world engineering design problems, particularly large-scale, three-dimensional systems with complex geometries, and seek to demonstrate quantifiable performance gains—both in accuracy and efficiency—over traditional numerical methods.

## *(2) Structural Mechanics and Dynamics: System Identification, Design Optimization, Uncertainty Quantification*

At the M3 lab, we develop physics-based and data-driven models to predict the structural mechanics and dynamics of electro-mechanical devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs), MEMS and hardware devices. We use these models to support downstream tasks of importance to industry such as design/topology optimization, sensitivity analysis, system identification, inverse problems and uncertainty quantification. Key areas of interest include probabilistic simulations to predict uncertainty in dynamic response and development of deep learning frameworks for robust estimation and classification of modal parameters from large-scale, experimentally acquired frequency response function (FRF) datasets.

## *(3) Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics and Fluid-Structure Interactions*

Our research is focussed on understanding the fundamental physics of fluid flows and fluid-structure interactions at the micro and nano scale, which occur in diverse applications such as microfluidic devices, tribological systems, biological systems and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Modeling mechanical systems at micro and nano scales presents several interesting challenges due to unique, size-dependent properties and behaviors not seen in macro systems. For example, to model micro- and nanoscale fluid flows, effects such as surface tension, slip boundary conditions, film thickness dependent viscosity, intermolecular forces, and surface roughness need to be considered. Moreover, the working fluids in such systems commonly exhibit non-Newtonian characteristics (e.g., viscoelasticity, shear-rate dependent viscosity) that can significantly alter flow dynamics. At the M3 lab, we leverage analytical and computational approaches to resolve such complex flow fields in order to develop predictive frameworks for engineering applications.
